# ShenCPP
ShenCPP is a native port of the [Shen](http://shenlanguage.org/) programming language. Shen is a modern, functional Lisp that supports pattern matching, currying, and optional static type checking.

ShenCPP supports Shen version 11, which was released in May, 2013.

Current implementation is pretty slow.
